# GAME:  _WHERE IS WALDO_

### MOTIVATION

> This is a Per Scholas Project I built as part of our end of month Project to demonstrate software app/game  creation.

### INSTRUCTIONS

> This web app is based on finding Waldo.
>The Journey is dangerous, you can go to jail, get fined, and even risk death looking for waldo. If you don't find >him or you die, you lose.
>If you find him, you win.
>All said the main point of this program is to understand that everything that you see, hear, and interact with was >brought together in pieces, or built literally from the ground up. So, the Main take away of this program is to >show how amazing software development can be at creating something from nothing, and building and what >the endless what if possibilities are of building something in the digital world that can make a real difference for >us in the physical world.

Well, I hope you enjoy yourself and have fun.

### CREDITS

> I'm giving credits to Per Scholas our school, and **Jade Del Rosario-Bell**, and **Oussama Hamani** our >school teachers for taking us down this path of coding and programing logic.
