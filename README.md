### MOTIVATION

> This is a Per Scholas Project I built as part of our end of month Project to demonstrate software app/game  creation.

### TECHNOLOGIES
> No frameworks 
> html
> css
> JavaScript 

### IMPORTANT INSTRUCTIONS
>  In the game each block represents a location. 
> You must access one block or one location at a time. 
> Make sure to allow the video to completely finish on it's own before closing the block. You will know the video is finished when you see a Pop-up message for each box with a video. Allow the block/location to completely close before going into the next block or going into the  next location, otherwise the game will not function as designed. 

### DESCRIPTION

> This web app is based on finding Waldo.

>The Journey is dangerous, you can go to jail, get fined, and even risk death looking for waldo. 
>If you don't find him or you die, you lose.
>If you find him, you win.

>Some will see this as a game, some will see this as a mini adventure. 
>All said the main point of this program is to understand that everything that you see, hear, and interact with was brought together in pieces, or built literally from the ground up. So, the Main takeaway of this program is to show how amazing software development can be at creating something from literally nothing, and giving some light to the endless what if possibilities, of building something in the digital world that can make a real difference for us in the physical world.


### CREDITS
